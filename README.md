Dataset can be found [here](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/drive.google.com/file/d/16lrMrD3w0bnr_rzqEC7qwF2dRv2ulybv/view?usp=share_link__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!RDEdHaAs_Vesk88fGJJBFe2xssf3I-qSUH-KVFXN-avAS4hM8M27VyhgOQJR14yUHO7Jh56gZ6DfdcIt9qOIEb69zBLFBLwL5Qg$)

Download Dataset and copy folder Toys_and_Games/ into source/ to be able to read missing parts of dataset.

Python Version used: ```Python 3.9.6```

Running ```main.py``` reads feature vectors and trains vectors generated from ```train3``` on a pre-trained multi-layer perceptron.
